# Advent of Code

A collection of [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions written by me.

## Excuses, disclaimers and deflections

Note that solutions to questions 18 and 19 are particularly messy! The code
isn't always well refined and the parsing code in general is terri-brill, but
keep in mind kind viewer that these exercises were done under time pressure as a
'dirty but gets it done' solution!

All solutions were solved entirely by myself EXCEPT 22 for which I looked at
some hints as 3D overlap checking is just bloody awful.
